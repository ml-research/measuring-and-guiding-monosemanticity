            - **"is_structurally_consistent"**:  
            - For structured data (JSON, XML, lists, etc.): The syntax must be valid (e.g., proper JSON brackets, XML nesting, indentation). New fields, missing values, and unusual-looking entries are acceptable if they follow the format. Do not penalize incomplete or wrong values (e.g., a date with only a year, a currency symbol mismatch).
            - For text: The continuation should follow grammatical flow and be readable. If a format shift occurs (e.g., list to plain text), assess whether it remains coherent rather than forcing strict continuity.

            You must **only** evaluate **structure and style**. **Do not evaluate content, meaning, or data accuracy.**
